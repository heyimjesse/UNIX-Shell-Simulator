//Sprint #1 Backlog.
October 18 to October 23


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) I want to be able to create folders on my machine.
b) I want to be able to change my current working directory.
c) I want a text representation of what's inside of my working directory folder, or any folder I specify.
d) Check CRC cards.

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. (Directory) Create the class that keeps track of the current working directory and root directory.
a-2. (File/TextFile/Folder) Create the classes for different file types.
a-3. (ErrorChecker) Work on the class which checks the input for validity.
b-1. (Directory) Write a method that changes the current working directory.
c-1. (Printer) Write code that takes some string input and calls the standard output for Java with the string.
c-2. (LS) Work on the method which obtains the contents of the current working directory. (and print it)
c-3. (LS) Work on the method which obtains the contents of the specified directory. (and print it)
d-1. Check to ensure CRC cards are logically equivalent to our implementation.
