What did I work on in the last three days?
	- I brained storm implementation ideas for command classes, and how to call each command
	based on user input. I discussed with team members and decided to create a command superclass
	which will be inherited by all commands, and that to determine which command is executed
	we will use switch statements.
	- I completed the ErrorChecker class and made minor changes to other java files

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- I play to finish MKDir class and more depending on our next sprint assignments

Am I blocked on anything?
