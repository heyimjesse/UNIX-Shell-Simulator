What did I work on in the last three days?
  - Started working on LS recursive call
  - Made helper methods hasFileRecursive, getNextFile, LSRecursiveHelper
  - Wrote pseudocode for LS
  - Updated relevant javadoc

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
  - Finish writing getNextFile and LSRecursiveHelper

Am I blocked on anything?
  - Implementation of getNextFile is not clear to me
