What did I work on in the last three days?
	- I completed the Man class
	- I updated the javadoc for all command classes
	- I met with my group to modify implementation details of their classes to fix compile errors

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- I plan to debug and prepare to present to our TA

Am I blocked on anything?
