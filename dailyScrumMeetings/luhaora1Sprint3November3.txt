What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Working on bugs brought on from version control issues
	- Found literature on junit testing

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Plan to write test cases and fix bugs that are to be found

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Testing method is not immediately obvious for some methods (ie. ones that only print to console)
