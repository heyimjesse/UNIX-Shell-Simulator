What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Completed the Shell class
	- Added functionality to the driver
	- Removed helper methods that weren't being used/redundant code
	- Fixed bugs all around
	- Standardized the commands so they all follow the same style (same parameters, runCommand method)

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- I plan to finish whatever's left (Echo, Cat, File class) that my colleagues aren't doing.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Need file class to be functional before the commands that work with it can be implemented.
