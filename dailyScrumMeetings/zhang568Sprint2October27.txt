What did I work on in the last three days?
	- I updated the Directory, PathChecker, Navigate, errorChecker classes
	- I completed the CD, CWDString, PWD, MKDir classes
	- Did some testing on the aforementioned classes to ensure they work

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- I plan to finish DirectoryStack as well as pushd/popd, echo, and perhaps more depending on what's left.

Am I blocked on anything?
