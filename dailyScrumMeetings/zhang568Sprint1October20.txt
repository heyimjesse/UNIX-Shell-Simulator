What did I work on in the last three days?
	- I brain stormed the implementation of our product with my team mates and now I think we have a pretty good idea
	of what to do, and how everything will be put together.
	- I finished the classes: File, TextFile, Folder, Directory
	- I checked the crcCards for logical consistency and added a few more

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- I plan to finish the MKDir class, which will contain a static method with three parameters (folder name, path, folder object) 
	and will make a folder at the end of the path with the given name. 
	- I plan to work on the ErrorCheck class which will check to make sure the user input is valid.

Am I blocked on anything?
