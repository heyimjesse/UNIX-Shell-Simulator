What did I work on in the last three days?
- Created own CRC cards but decided group implementation was essentially a better version.
- Reviewed group CRC cards/code.

What do i plan to work on in the next three days?
- Finish implementing crcCards with group.
- Getting together with the group once again to continue with the sprint backlog.

Am i blocked on anything?
- Not at the moment.
